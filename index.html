      <p> 
          My name is Michael Osgood and I am a huge science and tech enthusiast. 
          I am a full-stack developer. I have completed a comprehensive full-stack 
          coding program through the University of California Irvine. I also work 
          as a User Acceptance Tester for an innovative software company in 
          Irvine, California.
    </p>  
    <p>
        When I was 20 years old, I enlisted in the U.S Air Force. 
        And no, I was not a pilot. I worked in the medical field, 
        more specifically Public Health. This career field spurred 
        my fascination with biology. So after four years in the Air 
        Force, I moved to Boulder, Colorado to study Ecology and Evolutionary 
        Biology at the University of Colorado. During that time, I 
        studied a myriad of topics to include biology, evolution, genetics, 
        ecology, chemistry, physics, human anatomy, and  physiology. 
        During college, I worked as a Support Analyst for a software company. 
        After graduating in 2015, I moved to California and continued 
        to work on the operations side of software for tech companies.
      </p>
      <p>
          After 3 years of working on the client-facing side of software, 
          I moved to the Product Management side as a User Acceptance Tester.  
          For this role, I work with the developers to test and troubleshoot 
          software before it goes to production. I have gained extensive 
          knowledge and practice in developing and testing software with the 
          latest technologies through the full-stack coding bootcamp. The coursework 
          covered many topics from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React.js, MySQL and 
          many other tools that have helped me become a full-stack developer.
